# Windows Optimiser - 29th April 2018

I originally coded Windows Optimiser for my mum, as she commonly had problems with her computer. The idea was that instead of her needing me every time there was an issue, she could simply select the problem she was experiencing, and Windows Optimiser would fix it for her most of the time.

Windows comes pre-packaged with many tools which can help you when problems occur on Windows systems. The troubleshooters within Windows are poor at detecting many common problems, so Windows Optimiser makes it simple to launch tools which could allow you to fix problems on your own.

## Features:

* Fix common networking problems
* Fix a slow/crashed desktop
* Look for damaged system files and replace them with correct ones (Fix strange buggy behaviour)
* Defragment your drives to speed up your system (Only applies to Hard Disk Drives)
* Access system settings quickly (msconfig, cleanmgr, desk.cpl, dxdiag)
* Logging system (mostly debug purposes)
* Colour system (just for fun)

## Patched code
The [original code](Windows%20Optimiser%204.4.bat) for Windows Optimiser did not run when I tested it under Wine. In order to preserve the original code, I created a new [patched version](Windows%20Optimiser%204.4%20(patched).bat) of Windows Optimiser which has received basic bug fixes and should run should you wish to try it.

Whilst Windows Optimiser does work, it was written very poorly and will not be recieving any updates.

## Usage
Right click [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smcclennon/old-projects/master/windows_optimiser/Windows%20Optimiser%204.4%20(patched).bat) and "Save link as". Ensure the file saves with the `.bat` file extension. You may need to enable viewing file extensions under "View" in file explorer.

If a security warning prevents you from doing so, you can also copy/paste the code in to a `.bat` file manually and run that instead.
